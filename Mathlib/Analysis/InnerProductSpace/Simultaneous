/-! # Spectral theory of self-adjoint operators

This file covers the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators on an inner product space.

The first part of the file covers general properties, true without any condition on boundedness or
compactness of the operator or finite-dimensionality of the underlying space, notably:
* `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.conj_eigenvalue_eq_self`: the eigenvalues are real
* `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.orthogonalFamily_eigenspaces`: the eigenspaces are orthogonal
* `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.orthogonalComplement_iSup_eigenspaces`: the restriction of the operator to
  the mutual orthogonal complement of the eigenspaces has, itself, no eigenvectors

The second part of the file covers properties of self-adjoint operators in finite dimension.
Letting `T` be a self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space `T`,
* The definition `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.diagonalization` provides a linear isometry equivalence `E`
  to the direct sum of the eigenspaces of `T`.  The theorem
  `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.diagonalization_apply_self_apply` states that, when `T` is transferred via
  this equivalence to an operator on the direct sum, it acts diagonally.
* The definition `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvectorBasis` provides an orthonormal basis for `E`
  consisting of eigenvectors of `T`, with `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvalues` giving the
  corresponding list of eigenvalues, as real numbers.  The definition
  `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvectorBasis` gives the associated linear isometry equivalence
  from `E` to Euclidean space, and the theorem
  `LinearMap.IsSymmetric.eigenvectorBasis_apply_self_apply` states that, when `T` is
  transferred via this equivalence to an operator on Euclidean space, it acts diagonally.

These are forms of the *diagonalization theorem* for self-adjoint operators on finite-dimensional
inner product spaces.
